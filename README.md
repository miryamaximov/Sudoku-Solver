# Sudoku Solver

This project is a Python-based Sudoku solver that uses a backtracking algorithm to fill in a 9x9 Sudoku grid according to standard Sudoku rules. The objective is to fill the grid so that every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9 without any repetitions.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles by recursively filling in the grid and backtracking when conflicts arise.
- **Customizable Board Input**: You can input your own 9x9 Sudoku board with empty cells represented by `0`.
- **Formatted Board Output**: The board is printed with borders for easy viewing, showing each 3x3 subgrid.
